## 🚀 My Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on.

### 1. [Modern Web Capabilities Showcase](./Modern%20Web%20Dev%20Code)
A single-page application built to demonstrate modern web development techniques. This project evolved from a university course (GIT418 at ASU) and serves as a personal showcase.

* **Features:**
    * **Live Weather API:** Fetches and displays real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API using AJAX.
    * **Theme Customizer:** Uses Web Storage (localStorage) to save the user's light/dark mode preference.
    * **jQuery UI Widget:** Implements the jQuery Accordion for organized content.
    * **JavaScript Slideshow:** A custom-built image carousel.
* **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), jQuery, AJAX.

### 2. [Unity C# Simulation (Study Abroad Sim)](./Study%20Abroad%20C%23%20Code)
A simulation built in Unity (C#) that models agent behavior. This project includes a `GameManager` to control simulation parameters and `AgentAI` scripts for individual agent logic.

* **Features:**
    * **Game Manager:** Controls simulation state (start, pause, results), scenario parameters (agent speed, spawn rates), and aggregates results.
    * **Agent AI:** Agents use `NavMeshAgent` to seek study spots, wait, or move to an exit, with behavior affecting a persistent `AgentGPA`.
    * **Dynamic Parameters:** The `GameManager` can update agent and train speeds live based on UI slider input.
* **Technologies:** C#, Unity Engine (`UnityEngine`, `UnityEngine.AI`, `UnityEngine.InputSystem`).

### 3. [Animated Mother's Day Web Card](./Mothers%20Day%20Card%20Code)
A beautiful and interactive digital card created to celebrate Mother's Day. This project uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a magical and heartwarming experience.

* **Features:**
    * **Interactive Start:** A "Tap to Begin" overlay to ensure audio/visual sync.
    * **Dynamic Effects:** Includes background music, an animated character, floating compliments, and particle effects (hearts, sakura petals, parallax clouds).
    * **Responsive Design:** Adjusts layout and effects for both desktop and mobile.
* **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3 (Keyframe Animations, Flexbox), JavaScript (ES6).

### 4. [Java Battleship (Ship Sinking Game)](./Java%20Battleship%20Code)
A classic game of Battleship built in Java. This console-based game allows the user to play in a standard mode or a "cheat mode" that reveals the ship locations.

* **Features:**
    * **Game Logic:** Manages game state, user input (coordinate guessing), and hit/miss/sunk tracking.
    * **OOP Design:** Uses `Ship` and `Sea` classes to manage the game board and ship placements.
    * **Game Modes:** Includes a "Play" mode (board hidden) and "Cheat" mode (board visible).
* **Technologies:** Java.
